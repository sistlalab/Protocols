# Protocols
Standard lab and field protocols can be found here. Any modifications require the confirmation of Dr. Sistla.  

Before beginning a new technique, review the entire protocol and set a meeting with Dr. Sistla to ensure that you fully understand the purpose, approach, and expected data range before starting the protocol.

This folder is arranged by:
*field collection protocols
*soil and plant processing protocols
*soil nutrient extraction protocols
*nutrient analysis protocols (plate reader)
*soil respiration and microbial biomass (SIR), field respiration
